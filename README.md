The project is intended for the own research of some factors that impact the life expectancy at birth, more precisely how the factors influence the hope. The study is based on statistical data collected from official sources.
In order to carefully create a work with a strong cohesion and a high degree of correctness of values, I took most of the data from the Our World In Data and World Bank websites. 7 variables were used in the analysis, with a consistent number of observations, specifically 113 countries. For the purposes of this study, life expectancy at birth represents an endogenous variable, the share of health expenditure in GDP, the gross domestic product per capita, the GINI coefficient, the number of doctors per 1000 inhabitants, the food index, the average number of years of schooling of adults (25+) are exogenous variables.
Empirical results revealed that the share of health expenditure in GDP, gross domestic product per capita, number of doctors, diet and level of education directly and positively influence life expectancy at birth. Income inequality negatively impacts life expectancy at birth, the relationship being inverse, from which it can be deduced that a high inequality between individuals prevents the improvement of the general health of the population.
